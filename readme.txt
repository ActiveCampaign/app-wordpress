1. Upload the entire "activecampaign" zip file to the Plugins section of WordPress, or "Add New" plugin and search for "activecampaign."
2. Visit the Settings > ActiveCampaign section in WordPress.
3. Fill in your ActiveCampaign connection details, then hit Update.
4. Choose which subscription forms to cache locally, any optional sub-settings for each, then hit Update again.
5. Use `[activecampaign form=ID]` shortcode to display a form anywhere on your site where shortcode syntax is supported.
6. Embed multiple forms onto a single page!
7. Enable site tracking to have page visits tracked to ActiveCampaign.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create ActiveCampaign subscription forms to use in WordPress? =

You need to be using [ActiveCampaign email marketing platform](http://www.activecampaign.com/) to use this widget. Create new subscription forms in the platform by going to the "Integration" section, then they will be available through this plugin.

= How does this plugin differ from copying and pasting the subscription form onto my site manually? =

This plugin makes it much easier to do without requiring you to know which theme (or core WordPress) files to modify. Also, copying and pasting HTML into WordPress can often cause odd display issues (depending on your WordPress theme).

= What happens after someone submits the subscription form on my WordPress site? =

The same thing that would happen if they submitted it from another site: it redirects back to the ActiveCampaign confirmation message, or a custom URL if you have that set up for the subscription form in ActiveCampaign (modify your forms under the "Integration" section).

If you enable the "Ajax" option of the plugin settings, you can have the form submitted without the page reloading (so the viewer never leaves the page).

= Can my form require an opt-in email confirmation be sent? =

Yes, you would just make sure that your form settings (in ActiveCampaign) have the Opt-in confirmation setting checked.

= I get a "Connection failed" message. What does this mean? =

Please make sure that your login information is correct, and that you have at least one Integration form already created in the ActiveCampaign system.
